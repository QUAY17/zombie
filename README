Lab 6: Array of Structures and all the other glorious things like enums and fgets/sscanf

Purpose_

Zombie Apocolypse program! Run it to play. The Zombie project implements an array of structs and asks us to access and record the data from user input. 

Conclusions_ 

The framework of the program came together in a few hours but I had some initial trouble accessing the data from the array struct. I did get the data to print out correctly and was able to delete uneccesary and repetitive lines of code. I then added the user input data checks and the index loop.
